2
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,498
I want everything.

3
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,228
How did that son of
a bitch get the file?

4
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,230
I don't know.

5
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,982
He just gave me the copies.

6
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,444
Which you were going to publish.

7
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,529
A quarter to six!

8
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,324
Wake up, this ain't a vacation!

9
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,163
Ten minutes for
showering! Get up, people!

10
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,380
Get up, people! Up, I said!

11
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,805
- Gastn!
- Yasolrzano.

12
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,850
Miguel!

13
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,476
Cspedes, Cspedes.

14
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,812
Enrique!

15
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,313
Contreras Vidal.

16
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,023
Stand up.

17
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,780
Button up that shirt,
this ain't a party.

18
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,327
One more infraction,

19
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,580
and you'll spend a month in isolation.

20
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,332
Joaqun!

21
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,667
Guzmn Loera.

22
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,463
Silence!

23
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,680
Five minutes for breakfast.

24
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,331
One hour in the courtyard.

25
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,583
Eyes down.

26
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,191
Time to eat!

27
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,301
Walk.

28
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,977
Silence!

29
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,520
Four more, go.

30
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,271
Good night, Samuel.

31
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,940
Good night, professor.

32
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,152
Good night, Quique.

33
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,822
Good night, Professor Rubn.

34
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,665
Let's go, bitches.

35
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,542
A quarter to six!

36
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,296
Get up, this ain't a vacation!

37
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,970
Out of your cells!

38
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,025
Backs against the wall, eyes down.

39
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,738
Don't look!

40
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,073
Eyes down.

41
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,991
I heard you've been crying at night.

42
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,577
Answer me!

43
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,496
- No.
- No, what?

44
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,789
No, sir.

45
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,626
If I find out you're crying and
the other inmates can't sleep...

46
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,506
I'll make you cry for
a month in isolation.

47
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,217
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

48
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,760
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

49
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,597
In this prison, you can only eat...

50
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,350
sleep...

51
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,352
and breathe.

52
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,814
Got it?

53
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,482
Yes, sir.

54
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,818
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

55
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,831
My daughter told me she
had sent more letters.

56
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,670
They never gave them to me.

57
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,839
Sons of bitches.

58
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,261
Is security always this tight?

59
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,021
Everything is forbidden here, Chapo.

60
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,988
Even dying.

61
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,488
One line. Walk.

62
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,092
Empty your bag.

63
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,735
This stays here.

64
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,657
Take off your ring,
earrings, and glasses.

65
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,918
Go on.

66
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,090
Next.

67
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,605
- Take off your clothes.
- Excuse me?

68
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,024
Take off your clothes, please.

69
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,860
I've been searched twice.

70
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,405
It's procedure.

71
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,825
If you refuse, there's the door.

72
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,288
Stand there, please.

73
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,061
You can't bring blue pens.

74
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,270
Excuse me?

75
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,940
I said you can't bring blue pens.

76
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:16,361
Miss, I've done everything you've asked.

77
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,820
Let me see my son.

78
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,999
Time's up.

79
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,173
It's no coincidence

80
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,758
they're not letting you see your mom.

81
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,723
It's one of their games, Chapo.

82
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,143
They want to break you.

83
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,527
How are the kids, and how's Mom?

84
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,989
Everyone's fine. They
want to know how you are.

85
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,702
Any news on Too and Cho?

86
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:54,292
They're in another cell
block, but that's all I know.

87
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,425
Did you talk to the person
who promised me a bigger cage?

88
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,676
All I can do for you...

89
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,930
is move you to another penitentiary.

90
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,682
A friendlier one.

91
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,738
He will keep his promise,
but he says you have to wait.

92
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,533
How long?

93
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,287
Years. A few, at least.

94
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,518
JOURNALIST GABRIELA SAAVEDRA
MURDERED IN STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES

95
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,983
Were you looking for this?

96
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,408
On your feet.

97
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,420
Let's take a walk.

98
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,049
Move.

99
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,445
Give me the keys.

100
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,672
Let's go.

101
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,296
What are you looking at?

102
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,343
Where?

103
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,011
Keep driving straight.

104
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,137
Has anyone made a friend here?

105
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,815
Do you mean the guards?

106
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,233
Yeah.

107
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,609
No.

108
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,861
They're watched all the time.

109
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,738
Their schedule changes
almost every single day.

110
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,115
What about the doctor?

111
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,616
The cooks?

112
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,784
No.

113
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,040
Same thing. The Lawyer
changes their schedule.

114
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,167
Who's the Lawyer?

115
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,836
She's in charge of the prison.

116
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,879
Wait, I thought De Tavira was in charge?

117
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,799
He only handles the
administrative stuff.

118
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,969
The Lawyer controls the daily stuff.

119
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,221
She's a criminal protected by the law.

120
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,474
Don't mess with her, Chapo.

121
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,335
All new houses have flaws.

122
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,797
I just need you to find
one so I can focus on it.

123
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:53,515
General Blanco's body
was found this morning.

124
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,436
He was one of the most important
men in the Federal Judicial Police

125
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,105
in our country. It is
believed to be a robbery.

126
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,524
The president is saddened
by this tragic event

127
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,361
and demands a thorough investigation.

128
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,327
General Blanco was my mentor, sir.

129
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,750
I'll help you find the
perpetrators, no matter what.

130
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:25,255
Thank you, Conrado. Let's
keep his family informed.

131
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,424
Of course.

132
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,194
A BRIEF AND MODERN HISTORY OF MEXICO

133
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,373
Hey.

134
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,001
What did you do to end up here?

135
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,169
I didn't do anything.

136
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:06,880
I'm innocent.

137
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:11,468
Me, too.

138
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,263
Ask my lawyer if you don't believe me.

139
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,099
And you, Professor? What did you do?

140
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,562
We blocked a road with my comrades.

141
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,480
We were protesting.

142
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,898
That's it?

143
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,652
The government considers
it a federal crime.

144
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:32,239
They treat us worse than
they treat you drug lords.

145
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,201
How long have you been here?

146
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,748
You really don't want to know, Chapo.

147
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,603
Any news?

148
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,188
The new house has got a fat cat.

149
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,397
Do you know him?

150
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,152
The fattest cat?

151
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,237
Yeah.

152
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,865
His kitten's been sick for some time.

153
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,576
They don't have money
to take her to the vet.

154
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,027
I can pay for your girl's treatment.

155
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,097
No dinner for Guzmn.

156
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,292
I need sleeping pills.

157
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,754
The doctor used to give us those.

158
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,632
But the Lawyer banned them.

159
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,095
We feel you, Chapo.

160
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,222
We can't sleep either.

161
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,807
But you're new here, Chapo.

162
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,395
With the punch you took,
you should ask see the doc.

163
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,939
Maybe he'll give you something.

164
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,288
If they catch you, they'll fuck you up.

165
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,539
Silence!

166
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,109
Good night, Samuel.

167
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,152
Good night, Professor.

168
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,697
Good night, Quique.

169
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,741
Good night, Professor Rubn.

170
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,410
Good night, Chapo.

171
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,081
Good night, Professor.

172
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,150
Out!

173
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,361
Out of your cells!

174
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,818
Get him out.

175
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,613
What is it?

176
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,864
What is it?

177
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,074
Come on.

178
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,451
What is it?

179
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,642
You can't have pills without
the doctor's authorization.

180
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,646
Who gave them to you?

181
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,526
Who gave them to you?

182
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,413
You're going to the padded room.

183
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,332
No, please, no!

184
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,292
Please... beat me!

185
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,794
Take my food!

186
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,880
But, please, don't send me
there, I'm begging you, please...

187
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:06,133
I'm begging you, please!

188
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,551
Please, I'm begging you!

189
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,511
Don't do this!

190
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,430
Don't send me there!

191
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,307
Please, don't! No!

192
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,352
No! Not that place!

193
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,938
No, no, no!

194
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:29,573
Samuel.

195
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,867
What's the padded room?

196
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,953
You sent him there.

197
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,290
Son of a bitch!

198
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,003
Watch your mouth, asshole.

199
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,464
Rubn was brave enough to be quiet.

200
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,048
Don't you be the one who snitches.

201
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,677
They'll hear us.

202
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,931
Quique here is scared
out of his fucking mind.

203
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,481
What's the padded room, Quique?

204
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,948
The worst punishment, Chapo.

205
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,373
It's the end of the world.

206
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,566
- Lunch time.
- I'm not eating.

207
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,831
Lunch time.

208
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,041
I'm staying here.

209
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,504
Walk!

210
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,590
Get them out.

211
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,511
What's going on?

212
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,513
What's going on?

213
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,880
The Lawyer would like to remind you

214
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,175
you have to follow the rules here.

215
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,347
Not eating breaks the rules.

216
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,025
Quique.

217
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,112
Have you ever been where Rubn is?

218
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:57,530
Just a couple of days.

219
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,366
And I don't ever wanna go back.

220
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,452
If the rooms weren't padded,

221
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,205
one would hurt themselves
out of desperation.

222
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,681
My daughter got worse.

223
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:46,973
Mom.

224
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,057
My boy.

225
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,392
My boy...

226
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,396
Darling...

227
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,565
I'm sitting there.

228
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,702
I've been praying for you every day.

229
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,246
Look at you.

230
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,502
Don't worry, mom.

231
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,754
I'm tough as nails.

232
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,601
Chapo says you owe him.

233
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,205
Good night, Samuel.

234
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,165
Good night, Chapo.

235
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,169
Good night, Quique.

236
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,255
Good night, Chapo.

237
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,971
How long until Rubn is back?

238
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,974
A couple of nights, and
the punishment will be over.

239
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,199
Breakfast!

240
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,296
Rubn.

241
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:07,924
Professor.

242
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,010
Rubn.

243
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:13,888
Professor.

244
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,206
Professor.

245
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,876
You're loyal.

246
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,379
I owe you.

247
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,067
Rubn.

248
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,903
Professor.

249
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,238
What are you doing?

250
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,827
- Professor.
- What are you doing?

251
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,872
- He's hanging himself!
- He's hanging himself!

252
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,316
Let me die. Let me die.

253
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,109
Put him back in his cell.

254
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:53,738
Watch him 24/7. I don't want
him doing something stupid.

255
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,407
Let me die...

256
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,034
Please...

257
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,794
Take him to the doctor.

258
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,259
Help him like I helped
your daughter, asshole!

259
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,016
Open up.

260
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,691
You're such a tough guy...

261
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,615
Take him to isolation.

262
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:07,481
